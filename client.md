  "name": "CATRNNâ€™s MLE-STAR Darwin Machine 1.0a (CATv0-STAR)",
  "description": "A self-evolving MLE agent that retrieves, evolves, and benchmarks ML code by combining web-scale model search with Darwinian code mutation. It refines solutions through targeted exploration of ML components, guided by ablation studies and empirical validation. Variants are archived in a growing tree, enabling recursive self-improvement. Ensemble strategies are built from top-performing variants. CATv0-STAR automates end-to-end ML asset extraction, model coding, and benchmarking, outperforming existing agents."
